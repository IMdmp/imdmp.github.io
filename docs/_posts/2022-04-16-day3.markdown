# Day 3 

## Ruby on Rails
- Learned about controllers in ruby today. Will continue tomorrow on the deep dive. 

## Android 
- TIL that setting the plugins is what sets what type of android module it's going to be.

For example given

```
plugins {
    id 'com.android.library'
    id 'kotlin-android'
}
```

on build.gradle(app level) of a module - this wil be an android library.

but if it's like this:

```
plugins {
    id 'com.android.application'

}
```

^ This will be an an "app and phone" module. A standalone module that can run itself.
It's the equivalent of the "app" the we are so accustomed to.


So if it is the latter, we can individually run it as if its its own application in the run part.
But if we want to connect it to "app" we need to change it to former.
