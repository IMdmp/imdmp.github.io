# Day 11

## Android 
- Init new PR for repository module - search feature

## Ruby on Rails
- Learned about scopes They're mostly good for one liners.

In Ruby 2.x , they used to be more useful, but in Ruby 3.x where everything returns a relation instead, it makes more sense to use classes now especially for 2+ lines.
